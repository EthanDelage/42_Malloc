 * @brief Maps a region of memory with the specified size.

 * This function uses the `mmap` system call to map a region of memory into the

 * The size of the region must be a multiple of the system's page size.
 *
 * The memory region is allocated anonymously and is not backed by any file.
 * The region is private to the process, meaning changes to the region are not
 * visible to other processes.
 *
 * @param size The size of the memory region to be mapped. This must be a
 * multiple of `sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)` (the system's page size).
 * @return A pointer to the beginning of the mapped memory region, or
 * `MAP_FAILED` if the mapping fails.
